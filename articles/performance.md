# Delivery Performance

[The myth of developer productivity](https://nortal.com/us/blog/the-myth-of-developer-productivity/)
* Time before delivery - time since the moment business asks for a feature until it is in production
* Time in progress - time since work is started on a task until it is delivered
* Time in phase - how long is a task in each phase (design, development, qa, review, etc)
* Flow control - don't work on too much in parallel, focus on geting tasks completed rather than starting on something new
