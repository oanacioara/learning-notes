# Delivery Performance

[The myth of developer productivity](https://nortal.com/us/blog/the-myth-of-developer-productivity/)
* Time before delivery - time since the moment business asks for a feature until it is in production
* Time in progress - time since work is started on a task until it is delivered
* Time in phase - how long is a task in each phase (design, development, qa, review, etc)
* Flow control - don't work on too much in parallel, focus on geting tasks completed rather than starting on something new

[What Should We Measure?](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/what-should-we-measure/)
* When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure (Goodhart's Law)
* Slack Time - the time in which the team can work on tasks meant to improve the process
* Speed
  * How long does it take a new idea to go from a green light to positive user feedback?
  * How long does it take a build to complete?
  * How long does it take to recover from an unexpected delay or production "event?"
  * How long does it take to run the tests?
  * How long does it take (on average) to get an answer from a subject matter expert?
  * How much time does the team spend waiting on vendors?
  * How long are features finished and approved, waiting for a release?
  * How long does a branch live before being merged to the main code line?
* Escaped Defects - defects that the team misses
