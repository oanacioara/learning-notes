# Communication

## Listening

### Mental preparation
Practice listening to the sounds around you a few minutes a day.

Listen with your `ears`, `eyes` and `heart`.

Be aware of your position: `active/passive`, `critical/empathetic`, `reductive/expansive`.

### The act of listening
Keep `eye contact`, sit up right, lean forward, gently let the person know that you are listening by nodding or making soft sounds.


Depending on the situation choose either to `summarise` what was said or to simply `echo` it back.
