# Communication

## Listening

### Mental preparation
* Practice listening to the sounds around you a few minutes a day.
* Listen with your `ears`, `eyes` and `heart`.
* Be aware of your position: `active/passive`, `critical/empathetic`, `reductive/expansive`.

### The act of listening
* Keep `eye contact`, sit up right, lean forward, gently let the person know that you are listening by nodding or making soft sounds.
* Depending on the situation choose either to `summarise` what was said or to simply `echo` it back.

## Influencing
* Engage your audience by asking `creative questions`.
* Don't be afraid to be weird. Weird = Dopamine.
* When you talk to people `make it all about them`. Listen with interest, ask open-ended questions like why and how, add to the conversation using "yes, and..." or "no, but...".
* Your `body language` is very important. Certain positions of your body increase your testosteron level that has an impact on your clarity of mind and self-confidence. Also, having open positions makes the other person feel connected to you.
* Have interesting `stories` for different topics.
* `Vulnerability`
* Asking people for favors helps building a deeper connection with them.
